2. Boosts Accessibility  
It ensures that information is available to a wider audience, including individuals with different literacy skills, non-native speakers, and those utilizing assistive technologies. This inclusivity is particularly vital in documents aimed at the public or in international communications.

3. Establishes Trust and Credibility  
Clear and direct communication promotes transparency and dependability. Readers are more inclined to trust organizations that convey their messages in a human-centered manner, steering clear of vagueness or the sense of obscuring meaning with jargon.

4. Improves Efficiency  
When information is conveyed in plain language, readers can respond more decisively and swiftly, minimizing the need for clarification or additional explanations. This increases productivity for both the communicator and the audience.

5. Promotes Better Results  
In business settings, the use of plain language has been linked to greater customer satisfaction, fewer mistakes, and potential cost savings. For instance, the Royal Mail was able to save £500,000 by reformulating a form in plain language.





## 6. Can you provide examples of how simplifying terms (e.g., "start" instead of "initiate") improves comprehension?
